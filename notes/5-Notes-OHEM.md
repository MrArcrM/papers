## Notes-OHEM

- **What** did the author(s) try to **accomplish** ?
  - propose an online hard example mining(OHEM) algorithm, which eliminates several heuristics and hyperparameters in common use by automatically selecting hard examples, thus simplifying training. (illustrate with `Fast-RCNN`)
- What were the **key elements** of the approach ?
- **What can I use myself** ?
- What **other references** do I want to follow ?
