## Advices for paper reading

1. **Be ready to read papers**:
   + **Compile a list of papers**: to create a reading list
   + **Skip around the list**: decide what to drop in the list
     + After reading ``5~20`` papers, it's enough to implement a system
     + After reading ``50~100`` papers, you'll have a very good understanding of the domain application

3. **How to read a paper**:
   + **Go through**: Read the `Introduction` `Conclusions` `Figures` and skim the rest
   + **Go Detail**: Read the `Title` `Abstract` `Figures` and maybe `Experiments`
   + Read the paper but **skip the math**
4. **What to answer after reading a paper**:
   + **What** did the author(s) try to **accomplish **?
   + What were the **key elements** of the approach ?
   + **What can I use myself **?
   + What **other references** do I want to follow ?
5. **How much time it takes to understand a paper**: 1h~3h
6. **Sources of papers**: 
   + [`Paper with code`](https://paperswithcode.com/sota) 、`Github Paper list`、`Blog Post` for beginner
   + `Twitter`、`ML subreddit`、`Conferences` for sota
7. **To understand the math in papers more deeply**: Rederive it from scratch
8. **To practice Coding**: 
   + Download open-source code and run it
   + Reimplement from scratch
9. **To keep getting better**: It’s better to read `two papers a week` `for the next year` than cramming everything over a short period of time.
